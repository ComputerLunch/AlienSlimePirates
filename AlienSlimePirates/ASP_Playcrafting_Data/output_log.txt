Non-convex MeshCollider with non-kinematic Rigidbody is no longer supported in Unity 5.
If you want to use a non-convex mesh either make the Rigidbody kinematic or remove the Rigidbody component. Scene hierarchy path "LightSaber Pedestal/LightSaber/Blade/Beam", Mesh asset path "" Mesh name "Capsule"
